Welcome to CLI Auth's documentation!
===================================

We believe in a safe and secure web. That's why we
created **CLI Auth**, which lets you to better 
interactively authenticate your clients without hiding code.

It uses cryptographic signatures to ensure data security
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API, along with an
intuitive access control interface and extensive use cases.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, or refer to the :ref:`quickstart`
