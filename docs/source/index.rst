Welcome to CLI Auth's documentation!
===================================

We believe in a safe and secure web. That's why we
created **CLI Auth**, which lets you to better 
interactively authenticate your clients without hiding code.

It uses cryptographic signatures to ensure data security
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
